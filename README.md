# React summary

- React Kitchen Analogy.
traditional -> from scratch preparation.
components -> Precut veg (header, footer, button)
props -> Ingreding you pass (data, styling)
state -> current state of dish (loading, ready, burned)
hooks -> kitchen tools (useEffect=timer, useState= mixingbowl)

- Components:
everything in reacts is components, [Building blocks]. ex spotify play buttons

- Props: 
properties, passing specific instruction. one burger no onion with extra cheese

- State: 
memory of app, light switch on or off

- Hooks: superpower for components. ex smartphone and downloading apps
useState -> notes app(rember things)
useEffect -> Alarm clock(do things at specfic time)
useContext -> cloud storage(shared everywhere)
useReducer -> calculatore (complex operations)

- npx create-react-app portfolio
- rules of jsx:
everything should wrap in single tag
use of className instead of class
self closing tag must of '/'
use camelCase

- React Components:
Simple javascript function that return jsx
1. import statement (if needed)
2. component function (always start with capital letter)
3. javascript logic
4. return jsx (UI)
5. export so other can use it
